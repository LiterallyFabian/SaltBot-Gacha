#### Rolling
Users can roll using the [`-roll`](https://github.com/LiterallyFabian/SaltBot-Gacha/blob/master/commands/roll.js) command [10 times per hour](https://github.com/LiterallyFabian/SaltBot-Gacha/blob/5a907f9a8e9ffcd6a00e787a1009844d61eae74f/config.json#L17), but this can be increased by receiving ["Permanent rolls"](https://github.com/LiterallyFabian/SaltBot-Gacha/blob/master/routes/lootboxes.js) from loot boxes, or by using "Roll tokens". 

Any user can claim these characters rolled, but an user can only claim once every third hour. If a character is added to the rollers wishlist, this character will have higher chance of rolling. Using a "Super roll" will have a hard 25% chance of reducing the character pool to the rollers wishlisted characters.
